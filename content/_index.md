## Welcome to Tauiwi Solutions

Tauiwi Solutions was formed in 2006 as a facilitation and workshop service offered by cross-cultural Tauiwi facilitators based in Otepoti (Dunedin).

We have worked as facilitators since the 1980's and are skilled and experienced Te Tiriti educators. In 1990 we also pioneered decolonisation work for Pakeha and other Tauiwi peoples under the name Beams & Specks Workshops. These decolonisation workshops are focused on exploring how issues of colonisation affected us all.  Understanding who we are and where we have come from, discovering our ancestors stories, empowers us to confront the true story of settler colonisation in Aotearoa/NZ and face  the challenge of building a better future for our children and grandchildren alongside tangata whenua,
